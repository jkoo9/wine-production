makeover monday: Wine production

## this repo has three file folders
1) data
2) Excel analysis
3) Python

## Data
This makeover monday edition featured wine production data by country from 2012-2015 with a 2016 forecast. One thing to note:
1) if you total up the wine production by country per year, they do not match the annual world totals that were given in the data - perhaps the world totals are wrong but we could possibly be missing other country data

## Excel analysis
From the data that was provided, I further categorized the countries into regions.
