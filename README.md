makeover monday: Wine production

## this repo has three file folders
1) data
2) Excel analysis
3) Python

## Data
This makeover monday edition featured wine production data by country from 2012-2015 with a 2016 forecast. One thing to note:
1) if you total up the wine production by country per year, they do not match the annual world totals that were given in the data - perhaps the world totals are wrong but we could possibly be missing other country data

## Excel analysis
From the data that was provided, I further categorized the countries into regions to make it simpler to digest. So the original statement said the 2016 forecast wil decrease compared to the 2015 average but I wanted to dive in deeper in weather or not it was a global trend or it was isolated to specific regions/countries

Looking at the YoY absolute numbers and the percentages it look like South America was the biggest contributor to the world wide decrease in production in forecast. There were minor decreases in Europe and Asia but SA was by far the biggest. However, looking at the 2012-2015 data, it doesn't look like there is any explicit trend in terms of annual production.

YoY 2012-2015 data:
