makeover monday: Wine production

## this repo has three file folders
1) data
2) Excel analysis
3) Python

## 1) Data
This makeover monday edition featured wine production data by country from 2012-2015 with a 2016 forecast. One thing to note:
1) if you total up the wine production by country per year, they do not match the annual world totals that were given in the data - perhaps the world totals are wrong but we could possibly be missing other country data

## 2) Excel analysis
From the data that was provided, I further categorized the countries into regions to make it simpler to digest. So the original statement said the 2016 forecast wil decrease compared to the 2015 average but I wanted to dive in deeper in weather or not it was a global trend or it was isolated to specific regions/countries
PLEASE DISREGARD GRAND TOTAL LINES- just wasn't taken out (has nothing to do with analysis)

Looking at the YoY absolute numbers and the percentages it look like South America was the biggest contributor to the world wide decrease in production in forecast. There were minor decreases in Europe and Asia but SA was by far the biggest. Just to note, looking at the 2012-2015 data, it doesn't look like there is any explicit trend in terms of annual production. So because of this, I will just focus on SA and try to find out if there's any trends within the countries that make up SA.

YoY 2012-2015 data:

Focusing in on South America, I decided to expand on the countries that made up SA and see who was contributing to the big 2016 decrease.

Looks like all the countries significantly decreased with Brazil leading the pack. 
So now I'm thinking...what type of factors can cause decreases in production?

1) weather
2) any diseases or bug that could be causing harm to grapes
3) last year's sales were slow (perhaps production is based on the previous year's sales)
  > Perhaps there's there were low demand or trends for that year was for a different alcoholic beverage
  > 2016 was the year of the summer olympics in Brazil - perhaps staff or resources were used to fund that?
